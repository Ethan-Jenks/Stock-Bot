# Stock-Bot
A discord bot which implements a gameified stock ticker for users to interact with.

If you would like to use this you need to place a "private.txt" file in the same directory with 3 space separated strings:
Guild Id for your server
Token for your discord bot
The file path to your json credential file for a firestore database
